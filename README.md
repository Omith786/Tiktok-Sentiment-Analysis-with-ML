# Tiktok-Sentiment-Analysis-with-ML

This project investigates how people express themselves on TikTok by applying sentiment analysis techniques to user-generated content. The aim is to take raw text — such as video captions, comments, or hashtags — and classify it into categories like positive, negative, or neutral, giving a clearer picture of how audiences engage with the platform.

The backbone of the project is a machine learning pipeline that processes text through natural language preprocessing steps (tokenisation, cleaning, stopword removal, and vectorisation) before passing it into a trained sentiment model. By working with a large dataset of TikTok comments, the system learns not just to identify sentiment, but also to handle the platform’s unique style of language, including slang, emojis, and abbreviations that make traditional models struggle.

What makes this project particularly interesting is that it highlights how culture shapes online communication. TikTok isn’t just another social media platform; it’s a space where humour, trends, and micro-communities thrive. Analysing sentiment here provides insights not only into user reactions, but also into how digital communities evolve around trends.

From a technical perspective, the model is built to be adaptable: different classifiers (from LSTMs to transformer-based models) can be tested against the same dataset, making the project both a practical tool and a framework for experimentation. The results can be visualised through charts and dashboards that track sentiment trends over time or across different viral challenges.
